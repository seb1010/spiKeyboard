; Welcome to the USB Data In file
;
; This file has a very simple job
; Detects, reads and slams into memory one packet then calls decode function
;     Specific addresses are used for this purpose
;         usbIn has a address associated in the definitions file
;     data stored starts at the PID sync is discared
;     NRZI is decoded
;     bits are not destuffed
;     counter is used 
;     allows processing to be done while waiting for the sync to finish
;
; Thanks for reading
